# Hostel(WIP)
Smart Traditional Single Rooms Hostel using <b>Distributed Domain-Driven Design</b> and <b>Event-Sourcing</b>

# Domain Description
The Owner owns a Hostel with three floors(ground, first and second) and the floors with 20-23 rooms, 2-3 community toilets, 2 community bathrooms and a kitchen each!

# Problem
The Owner currently is facing these problems: Water scarcity, Poor Hygienity, Noise pollution, embarrassing septic tank spillage, poor rent followup and poor or no tenant data management!

# Solution
Various types of IoT sensors will be installed as follows: Sonic Sensor for Water and Septic Tank, Dirt and Smell detection for Toilets, Bathrooms and Kitchens and Noise detection Sensor installed at strategic locations!

Hostel will help this Owner monitor readings coming from the sensors and automate rent expiration notification. Birthday notification will be a bonus tool to add!

The Owner also desires to know which one of the toilets are used the most, so we will be tracking flush!
